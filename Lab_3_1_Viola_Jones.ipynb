    "# Viola-Jones and \"Haar-like\" Features\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will have seen in our video lectures, Paul Viola and Michael Jones introduced the Viola-Jones technique for finding objects in images in 2001. It is a classical machine learning approach, where a cascade function is trained using a training set of positive and negative images.  For the purpose of explanation, let's assume we're looking for faces in a photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viola-Jones has a number of important concepts, which we'll recap on:\n",
    " * Integral Images\n",
    " * Adaboost\n",
    " * Cascading\n",
    "\n",
    "The Viola-Jones algorithm typically uses a base patch size (for example, 24x24 pixels) that it slides across and down an image. It evaluates a number of hand-crafted template features within each of these patches to see if the object of interest is present. The types of hand-crafted features (known as *Haar-like Features*) are shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Viola-Jones Features](https://github.com/EmdaloTechnologies/CE6003/blob/master/images/lab3/VJ_features.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are equivalent to convolutional kernels. Each feature is evaluated to a single value by subtracting the sum of pixel intensities under the white rectangle from the sum of the pixel intensities under the black rectangle.  These sums of intensities can be computed extremely efficiently, and are responsible for much of the impressive speed of the Viola-Jones algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viola-Jones uses a summed area table - essentially a cache of intensity values across an image. The summed area table has the same dimensions as the image of interest. For example, assuming our input image is 640 pixels wide, by 480 pixels high, by 3 channels (RGB), it will first be converted to grayscale (640x480x3 -> 640x480x1). Next, we will construct a summed area table of 640x480x1 where the value at each pixel location in the summed area table is the cumulative sum of itself and each pixel to the left and above it in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Viola-Jones summed area table calculation](https://github.com/EmdaloTechnologies/CE6003/blob/master/images/lab3/ii.gif?raw=1 \"Viola-Jones summed area table calculation\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the summed area table, we can calculate the sum of intensity values over any arbitrary rectangular patch (an Integral Image) with 4 reads.  Assume that s(X) returns the summed table value for any point X. Now given points A, B, C, and D, then the Integral Image calculation for the rectangular patch defined by ABCD is defined as s(A) + s(D) - s(B) - s(C).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we end up with more than 160,000 possible features for even a 24x24 patch, it is important to realise that not all features will be equally relevant for a particular type of object. Each feature (essentially a weak classifier) is considered good if it predicts better than chance the presence (or absence) of the desired object.  Viola-Jones uses an algorithm called **Adaboost** to perform *adaptive boosting* of the performance of the cascade of features through a number of iterative rounds. For more details, see our associated video with this module.  Picking the best small set of suitable features helps make the detector super fast. The original Viola-Jones paper achieved 95% accuracy with an appropriately chosen 6,000 feature subset from the 160,000 set of possible features.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, having to run even 6,000 features on every patch would be a lot of effort. So, once the features have been decided and assembled, we build a cascade of fast rejectors. This is based on the intuition that over a complete image, most of the possible positions we check will not contain a face -- therefore it is faster overall to reject quickly than to invest too much in it. If the location doesn't contain a face, discard it and move on before investing more computational checks in it. This is another of the tricks used by Viola-Jones to achieve its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Viola-Jones Cascade of Classifiers](https://github.com/EmdaloTechnologies/CE6003/blob/master/images/lab3/VJ_cascade.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of applying all 6,000 features on a window, we'll group these features into different stages of weak classifiers through the use of Adaboost, and we run these weak classifiers one-by-one in a *Cascade*. If the patch window under consideration fails at any stage, we reject the window and move onto the next patch. Only if a patch window passes one stage of the cascade do we consider moving onto the computation and evaluation of features on the next. A patch which passes all stages is considered a valid detection!\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier stages of the cascade are organised in order of increasing number of features, to ensure that early rejections are quick and cheap. In the Viola-Jones paper, the detector had approximately 6,000 features organised into 38 stages - but the first five stages had 1, 10, 25, 25, and 50 features in them respectively. On average, approximately 10 features need to be evaluated per patch in their testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a nice consequence of our features being so quick to calculate (thanks to the Integral Image) leads to the final aspect of Viola-Jones performance.  The base patch itself can be scaled and the features in the final cascade evaluated very quickly to search for objects of different sizes *without* the requirement for an image pyramid. \n",
    "\n",
    "(We'll cover the concept of an *image pyramid* in detail when we explore our next technique, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients, but in summary an image pyramid involves rescaling the original image multiple times.  You can think of each slightly smaller image as being stacked upon the previous one vertically, hence the pyramid. As we'll see, scanning across each of these scales repeatedly leads to significant computational cost and effort.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all other, the Viola Jones workflow for training looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Viola-Jones - Training Flow](https://github.com/EmdaloTechnologies/CE6003/blob/master/images/lab3/viola_jones_flow.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run some code and see how well the Viola Jones algorithm works. To make it easy for you to experiment, we'll first load our test image into a variable... You can change this subsequently, and rerun the code to play with different images.\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we have seen examples of traditional object classification/detection systems, using hand-crafted features with shallow learning algorithms.  We have also seen the need for non-maximal suppression of results during object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viola-Jones is very fast, and has found much use in detecting faces in images. The main problem is the lack of accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "HOG is a more accurate detector. Its hand-crafted features detect gradients and gradient magnitudes for blocks of pixels, which is uses to learn characteristic sets of edges for a particular object detector.  However, it can be slow and often requires the use of a full image pyramid to perform detections at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years after its introduction, HOG and its derivative models represented the state of the art in object detection in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, researchers incrementally improved the speed of HOG through caching, and the clever adoption of Haar ideas such as cascades of fast rejectors and scaling features not images. Others attempt to add higher semantic layers to HOG by breaking objects into constituent parts (*deformable parts models*) which had hand-crafted spatial relationships with each other. For example, for people detectors, this could include breaking up the person into a head, torso, arms and legs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When CNNs were (re-)introduced to the problem of image classification with AlexNet in 2012, they were significantly more accurate than the best previous hand-crafted feature detector at the time, and they have continued improving at a faster rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll take a look at Microsoft's ResNet, which is a state of the art deep network for image classification.  We will also discuss the techniques deep nets are currently using to avoid requiring to scan the entire image pyramid, as we do above with the HOG example.\n"
